# a_league_experiment
Capture League live play, recording recurrent sentiment analysis on comments / toxic behavior, find how it relates to winning / losing / reporting.

# modules used:
I have used Cassioepia to interact with the Riot API.
I have also used the OpenAI interface in order to gain sentiment analysis.
The model I have used is based on Keras layers as supplied by Google Tensorflow.
I have used a regex tool to help me construct the pattern to recognize chat logs.
In addition, I have used the interface of a image to text detection AI to parse chat logs in real time.
All code otherwise would be my own, and sources would be specified in the comments.

# running
Python 3.11 is required to run this application.
